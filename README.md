## Features
In this small bouncing ball program, the user can add balls by press space key,
and change the color of a ball by clicking on it. Besides, there are obstacles 
represented as black rectangles in the screen. Once a ball hits the obstacle, 
the ball will die and disappear from the screen. Users are freely to add or remove
the obstacle by clicking on it. 
The background color of the bouncing ball is ties to current average CPU usage. If
the CPU usage gets higher, the color gets darker, and when the CPU usage becomes
lower, the color gets brighter. This update happens every 3 secs.
